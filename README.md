### **THIS is my archived first person controller asset made in 2023 in Unity. I tried to publish it in the Unity Asset store, but it was not approved. A few years later I decided to post the source code to github.**

The controller has a stamina system, running, crouching, checking objects above you, smooth acceleration and deceleration, etc.

*there is also documentation*
